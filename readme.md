## some tips on Django
create a project
```
$ django-admin startproject mysite
```

create the Pools app
```
$ python manage.py startapp polls
```

configure database in `mysite/settings.py`

store changes to models as a migration
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations polls
```
it'll geneate file ` polls/migrations/0001_initial.py`

check the migration SQL
```
$ python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
```

do the migration
```
$ python manage.py migrate
```
The migrate command takes all the migrations that havenâ€™t been applied (Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called django_migrations) and runs them against your database.

the Django shell
```
$ python manage.py shell
```
